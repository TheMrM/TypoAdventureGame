Dragon Slayer Game
    In this game, the player's objective is to fight and defeat a dragon. The player has two weapons to choose from: a sword and a bow. However, before they can fight the dragon, they must choose between two paths, left or right.

    If the player chooses the left path, they will go through a forest and encounter a spider. If they choose the right path, they will go through a cemetery and encounter a ghost. The player must defeat the spider or the ghost before moving on to fight the dragon.

    The player will use a dice roll to determine their actions during the fight. The dice will have six sides, and the roll outcome will be used to determine the player's success or failure. A low roll will result in a miss, and the player will lose a life. A medium roll will hit the enemy, but the player will lose a life as well. A high roll will result in a successful attack, and the enemy will lose lives.

    The player starts the game with five lives, and the spider or ghost will have three lives each. The dragon will have four lives.

    If the player defeats the spider or ghost, they will move on to fight the dragon. If the player defeats the dragon, they win the game. If the player loses all their lives, the game is over.

    To start the game, the player will be prompted to choose left or right. They will then encounter either the spider or the ghost, and the fight will begin. The player will have the option to choose the sword or bow and use dice rolls to attack. If the player defeats the enemy, they will move on to fight the dragon.

    Overall, the game requires strategy, luck, and quick thinking. The player must carefully choose their weapon, and they must make wise decisions during the fight to avoid losing all their lives.
